?> Write a program to take a specific number of integer inputs from the user and store them in an array, then print all the elements of the array.
Sol:>
In this program, Iâ€™m taking a certain number of integers from the user and keeping them inside an array (list).
After that, I just print all the numbers one by one.
Itâ€™s a very simple example of how to store user inputs in Python.

CODE:>

#number of elements from user
n = int(input("Enter how many numbers you want to input: "))

# Create an empty list
arr = []

# Take n integer inputs
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input(f"Enter number {i + 1}: "))
    arr.append(num)

# Print all elements of the array
print("\nThe elements in the array are:")
for i in arr:
    print(i)

=>Example output:
Enter how many numbers you want to input: 4
Enter number 1: 5
Enter number 2: 10
Enter number 3: 15
Enter number 4: 20

The elements in the array are:
5
10
15
20
