problem: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number:
         a) Using iteration (without recursion)
         b) Using recursion

what is factorial?
=>The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.It is denoted by (n).
like: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

a) here the the python code without recurtion:--

Code:
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if n < 0:
    print("Factorial of negative numbers does not exist.")
else:
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fact *= i
    print(f"Factorial of {n} = {fact}")



b)here the python code using recurtion:--

Code:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if n < 0:
    print("Factorial of negative numbers does not exist.")
else:
    print(f"Factorial of {n} = {factorial(n)}")
