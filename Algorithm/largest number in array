This Python program finds the largest number from a list entered by the user.
First, it asks the user how many numbers they want to enter, then collects those
numbers in a list. It assumes the first number is the largest and then compares it 
with the rest of the numbers using a loop. If it finds a number greater than the current
largest, it updates the largest value. Finally, it prints the largest number from the list.
This approach uses simple logic without built-in functions like max() to help understand how 
comparison works in loops.

n = int(input("How many numbers will you enter? "))
arr = []

print("Enter the numbers one by one:")
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input())
    arr.append(num)

# Assume first element is the largest
largest = arr[0]

for num in arr:
    if num > largest:
        largest = num

print("The largest number is:", largest)
